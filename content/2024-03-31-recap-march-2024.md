What a month:

 * Had fun reading [Bluetooth specs](https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/specs/fitness-machine-service-1-0/) and finished the [prototype of my rowing monitor](https://github.com/stefanjenkner/fdf-console-monitor) which exposes data from my water rower (distance, stroke rate, watts, ...) to my watch or interconnected indoor rowing apps like [EXR](https://exrgame.com/)
 * [CLT2024](https://chemnitzer.linux-tage.de/2024/en/) was great - most of the talks can be found [online](https://media.ccc.de/c/clt24)
 * Switched my main desktop to [Fedora Asahi Remix](https://asahilinux.org/) - pretty impressed how stable and smooth it is
 * Updated home server to Fedora 39 and gave up on switching to [systemd-homed](https://systemd.io/HOME_DIRECTORY/) - not yet ready for prime time due to [SELinux policy issues](https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/building-a-new-home-with-systemd-homed-on-fedora/72690) but will give it another try after the next Fedora release or on Debian (probably w/o SELinux issues)
