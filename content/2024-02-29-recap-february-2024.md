Initially, this blog was intended to serve as a developer's notebook. However, over the past 10 years, many of the articles I wrote about various technologies have become obsolete or outdated, leading me to unpublish them.

Despite this, I enjoyed skimming through the [Git commit history](https://github.com/stefanjenkner/stefanjenkner.github.io/commit/3e34911c698753fcab07389e0b17616f660d5165) and I decided to revive this blog and start a monthly recap category. So, here we go!

 * Spring cleanup on my [GitHub account](https://github.com/stefanjenkner?tab=repositories) - went from over 50 down to 16 repositories
 * [DecompileD 2024](https://decompiled.de/) conference was great
 * I'm very excited about [Dagger](https://dagger.io/)
 * Started reading ["Looks Good to Me" - Constructive code reviews (MEAP)](https://www.manning.com/books/looks-good-to-me)
 * Had fun flashing my Xiaomi Mi Smart LED Desk Lamp Pro with [custom firmware](https://devices.esphome.io/devices/Mi-Desklamp-Pro)
 * Decided to convert some of my [Gists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub#Gist) into blog articles - stay tuned
